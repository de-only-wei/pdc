# CMS UI Improvements - Fixed âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Sidebar Disappearing

**Problem**: Sidebar was not staying visible when scrolling

**Solution**:

- Made sidebar `fixed` position with `left-0 top-0`
- Added `flex flex-col` for proper layout
- Main content now has `ml-64` (margin-left: 256px) to account for fixed sidebar
- Sidebar stays visible at all times

### 2. âœ… Login Screen Colors Not Legible

**Problem**: Labels had poor contrast on white background

**Solution**:

- Changed label text color to `text-gray-700` for better contrast
- Improved input field height to `h-12` for better usability
- Redesigned info box with better colors:
  - Changed from yellow to blue theme
  - Better text color (`text-blue-900`)
  - Added proper spacing and line breaks
  - Larger font size for credentials (`text-sm` instead of `text-xs`)

### 3. âœ… Poor Spacing Throughout

**Problem**: Cramped layout with insufficient spacing

**Solution**:

- **Login Page**:
  - Increased form spacing from `space-y-4` to `space-y-6`
  - Added proper margin (`mt-8`) before credentials box
  - Increased button height to `h-12`
- **Dashboard**:
  - Increased title size from `text-3xl` to `text-4xl`
  - Added proper spacing to subtitle (`text-lg`)
  - Increased bottom margin from `mb-8` to `mb-10`
  - Added `space-y-8` to main container
- **Projects Page**:
  - Increased title size to `text-4xl`
  - Better form spacing with `gap-6` (was `gap-4`)
  - Edit card has shadow and better visual separation
  - Form footer has proper border and spacing (`mt-8 pt-6 border-t`)
- **Sidebar**:
  - Added proper flex layout for logout button at bottom
  - Added border separator (`border-t border-gray-600`)
  - Better spacing between nav items

### 4. âœ… Additional Improvements

- **Max Width Container**: All admin pages now have `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for better content width
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Consistent heading sizes and spacing
- **Better Cards**: Added shadows and borders for depth
- **Hover States**: Improved button hover effects
